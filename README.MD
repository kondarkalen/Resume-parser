# Automated Resume Parsing and Candidate Evaluation System

## Project Overview

In today's competitive job market, efficiently and accurately matching candidates with job requirements is essential for both employers and job seekers. Our project aims to develop a sophisticated resume parsing system designed to assess candidate eligibility for job positions. This system will analyze resumes and evaluate candidates based on their alignment with the specified job requirements. The evaluation will be quantified through a scoring mechanism that objectively measures the degree of match between the candidate’s qualifications and the job criteria.

## Key Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Automatically extract relevant information from resumes such as education, experience, skills, and certifications.
- **Job Requirement Matching:** Compare the extracted resume data with job requirements to determine eligibility.
- **Scoring Mechanism:** Calculate a score that represents the alignment between the candidate’s profile and the job requirements.
- **Automated Eligibility Assessment:** Provide a clear and concise evaluation of each candidate’s suitability for the position.

## Implementation Details

### Library Imports
To start the project, we import essential libraries such as `spaCy` and `NLTK` for natural language processing (NLP), and `Scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms.

### Loading and Setting Up the Pipeline
We set up an NLP pipeline using spaCy, customized to extract key entities from resumes. This pipeline is trained to recognize education, experience, skills, and other relevant details.

### Data Extraction and Score Calculation
We implement methods to extract structured data from unstructured resume content. The extracted data is then compared against the predefined job requirements to calculate a compatibility score.

#### Data Extraction Methods
Using NLP techniques, we accurately extract and categorize information from resumes. This includes identifying specific skills, years of experience, educational background, and certifications.

#### Methods
The scoring algorithm weighs the extracted resume data against the job criteria to produce a final score. This involves calculating the relevance of each data point and summing these to give an overall match score.


## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **NLP Libraries:** spaCy
- **Front-End** HTML,CSS,JavaScript

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Job Portals:** Directly pull job descriptions and candidate resumes from popular job portals.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implement machine learning models to predict candidate success in specific roles.
- **User Experience** Provide the best UI experience to our users accessing through website.

## Conclusion

Our automated resume parsing and candidate evaluation system aims to revolutionize the hiring process by providing a reliable and efficient tool for matching candidates with job requirements. By leveraging advanced technologies and methodologies, we strive to enhance the recruitment experience for both employers and job seekers.
